Hello, this is a README and thank you for reading me. I'm here to let you 
know how the newsletter system works.
All newsletters are based off the HTML file "_newslettertemplate.html". This
file is basically a blank lorem ipsum version of the newsletter and is formatted
accordingly. The CSS in the file has the ruleset "body" and contains a CSS
variable named "--windowsColors". This ruleset controls the color of the blue windows
on the page, and can be changed to whatever color you want. Every issue of
the newsletter should have a different color. Also, don't forget to change the 
header's info to reflect the issue number, the month, and the year.

All images need to fit 600x400 or 400x600 px size in order to display properly.
This can be achieved by cropping, but you can also scale down images if they
are too big. Remember never to scale a small image up since it degrades in quality
as you stretch it.

To start a new page, first archive the current "currentnewsletter.html" with the format [MM-YYYY-IssueNum].html and store it in this
folder. Then, copy and paste the "_newslettertemplate.html" file (don't override it), renaming it to currentnewsletter, then you can
start doing whatever you need to do.

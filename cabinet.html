                    <h2>Pablo Hernandez - President</h2>
                    <p>Howdy! I am dual majoring in computer science and cyber security. I started my journey when the pandemic hit. Over quarantine, I began to teach myself web development to secure a future where I don't have to work in a kitchen. In the Fall of 2022, I was still unsure if computer science was what I wanted to pursue, so I joined the club, and my life has completely changed since. This club provided me with a space to actively grow and become a better coder. Through this club, I have worked closely with Dr. Servin to organize workshops/events. I have also had the opportunity to network with many amazing students whose intelligence motivates me to improve. After about a year of attending club events, I have made it my mission to keep this club alive so that more students can see what is possible in computer science and their potential.</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Akari Monserrat Olivares Soto, or just Akari or Monse. I am the treasurer of the Computer Science Club at El Paso Community College.
                        So that means I manage the funds of the club. I am majoring in Computer Science, and I heard about this club through Mrs. Karichev during my classes with her. 
                        I joined the club to get engaged more socially since I get very nervous when I have to talk with new people. When I graduate, I hope to become a video game developer.

                    <h2>Alejandro Solano - Events Chair</h2>
                    <p>This is my third year at El Paso Community College, and though I struggled for the first year outside of high school, my drive to improve myself and skills lead me here. 
                        This marks my first  semester as a cabinent member. Computer science is my bread and butter since the beginning of high school through a magnet program called SATA. 
                        From here I've gather experience in many programming languages, conducting research in the field, and competing in any sort of event that included coding. 
                        This continued after my first year in college as I pursued a focus into Cybersecurity. 
                        Under Dr. Servin, I performed research into adversarial thinking and bringing the concepts into intro classes for computer science in hopes of building the integrity of future programmers. 
                        Currently, through the mentorship of Dr. Servin I continue my research into Cybersecurity and hope to expand towards fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

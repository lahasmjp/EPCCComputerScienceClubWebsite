# Welcome to the Beta Repository for EPCC's Computer Science Club Website!
This is the repository for EPCC's Computer Science Club website. It is still being developed, but I've decided to put it
up here for feedback and in case anyone wanted to add anything to it.

## Here are some ground rules for anyone that wants to commit to this project!
- **DO NOT** try commiting to the *"main"* branch. Create your own branch, then when you're ready to propose we use your code, submit a pull request to be considered.
- Make Summaries short but impactful. State their purpose as uniquely as possible so we can tell commits apart. (Ex. Instead of "Visual Improvements", write something like "Heading Padding Alterations" or "Big Color Changes".)
- While changelogs were required before, as of 8/11/23 they are not... Though it would be neat if you detailed changes further whether that is in changelog format or not.
- This is more of a future-proofing rule in case this site remains on GitHub Pages, but content updates need to be formatted as "Content Update MM/DD/YY".
- While I personally encourage some silliness, try to stay professional!
- Adhere to the website's mission below. Before adding something, think: does it make sense to add to the website?

## Our Website's Mission
We've created this website to serve as a place to find information about the club. It is meant to give students information at both a glance and in-detail depending on what this info may be.
It is meant to keep students enticed, updated, and connected with the club regardless of whether they are members or not. The website will also, eventually, host a token system in the near future.

**Regardless of whether you contribute or not, happy coding!!!!!**
